## ¡Hola! 👋

I'm Iñigo. I'm a superposition between Physicist and Software Engineer.

I love computing in all its forms, from low-level assembly to cluster computing, passing by quantum computing and non-conventional computing paradigms.
Besides programming, I also do electronics and all sorts of DIY projects.

I love FOSS and the Maker Culture.
